  <h1>CredLink</h1>
  <p><em>Unified Life-Stage Digital Identity & Record Network</em></p>
</div>

**CredLink** is a digital credential infrastructure platform designed to simplify how academic and institutional records are issued, stored, shared, and verified across organizations.

The platform connects trusted issuers, individuals, and verifiers through a consent-driven credential lifecycle, with a focus on interoperability, privacy, and secure verification.

> **Current milestone:** Supabase-backed authentication, institutional authorization, credential lifecycle, consent management, verification, and audit logging.

---

## Overview

Traditional record verification often involves repeated document submissions, manual validation, and fragmented institutional systems.

CredLink aims to reduce this friction through a unified digital credential ecosystem in which:

- **Institutions** issue and manage digital credentials.
- **Individuals** control consent for sharing their records.
- **Verifiers** request and validate credentials for authorized purposes.
- **Network administrators** oversee institutional trust and platform governance.

The project follows a user-centric identity approach, with the long-term goal of supporting standards-based Verifiable Credentials and self-sovereign identity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the following before running the project:

- Node.js
- npm
- pnpm
- Git
- A configured Supabase project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhumii-10/CredLink-2.0.git
cd CredLink-2.0
```

### 2. Configure the Backend

Navigate to the backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file using the required variables from `.env.example`.

Configure your Supabase project URL, keys, authentication settings, and any other variables required by the backend.

Build the backend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the backend using the development or start script defined in `backend/package.json`.

### 3. Configure the Frontend

From the repository root:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

Configure the frontend environment variables using the relevant example configuration.

Set the backend API URL to your local backend address.

Navigate to the web application:

```bash
cd apps/web
```

Build the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the application using the available scripts in the frontend package.

> **Note:** Environment variable names and available start/test scripts should be checked in the corresponding `.env.example` and `package.json` files. Never commit real environment secrets.

---

## Credential Lifecycle

The current backend supports the following database-backed workflow:

```text
Institution Login
       |
       v
Organization Authorization
       |
       v
Credential Issuance
       |
       v
Supabase Persistence
       |
       v
Verifier Requests Consent
       |
       v
Citizen Reviews Request
       |
       v
Consent Approval
       |
       v
Credential Verification
       |
       v
Verification Result & Audit Log
```

Credential revocation is also supported. A revoked credential is rejected by the current verification workflow.

## Security & Data Principles

CredLink is designed around the following principles:

- **Least privilege:** Access is restricted according to authenticated roles and institutional membership.
- **Organization isolation:** Backend authorization checks organization context rather than trusting client-supplied identifiers.
- **Consent-driven sharing:** Individuals approve requests to share their information.
- **Credential lifecycle tracking:** Issuance, revocation, consent, and verification events are recorded.
- **User-held credentials:** The intended architecture keeps the full usable Verifiable Credential in the citizen's wallet rather than relying on a centralized credential vault.
- **Separation of concerns:** Supabase supports institutional source records, credential metadata and status, consent receipts, audit records, and trust information.

The current prototype uses an application-level HMAC-SHA256 signature for its existing credential workflow. This is **not yet a standards-based W3C Verifiable Credential signature**.

## Project Vision

**One trusted digital identity. Records that move with the individual. Sharing that stays under their control.**

CredLink aims to provide an interoperable foundation for trusted digital records across education, healthcare, finance, and employment.
